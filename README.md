#BankistApp allows you to keep track of your transactions through a bank account, you will deposit $500 in entrance for opening your bank account.

#In the beginning of the app you will find an interface where you can login through your user and PIN, you have to create one in the pink field "Here"

#You will be sent to a form where you simply have to enter your name and sunname, eg: (enrique ortiz) and your PIN with 4 Digits, once you do it
#The interface will deploy you an alert with your username (the first letter of your name and lastname), eg: enrique ortiz --> eo
