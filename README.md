#BankistApp allows you to keep track of your transactions through a bank account, you will get $500 deposited in entrance for opening your bank account.

#In the beginning of the app you will find an interface where you can login through your user and PIN, you have to create one in the pink field "Here"

#You will be sent to a form where you simply have to enter your name and sunname, eg: (enrique ortiz) and your PIN with 4 Digits, once you do it
#The interface will deploy you an alert with your username (the first letter of your name and lastname), eg: enrique ortiz --> eo

#You can do three operations here:

# --> Request a Loan: Bank will add you money to your account and will display your movements in the white field in the left side below.
# --> Transfer money: You can transfer money to an existing user, eg: carlos loera --> cl and the Amount you want to transfer him. Of course, you will #need
# to have enough funds to send him that money.
# --> Close account: You got tired of banks and you wanna hold your money under your pillow (the good one) and simply close your account, you will have #to
# confirm it with your username and PIN then to a confirmation dialog to delete it, (yeh i know bank interestRate sucks sometimes..)

# You can also sort your movements in the Sort button under your movement display

# If you want to log off you can click in the button "Log out" below Close account field.

# NOTE: the application is a beta version ATM. it's thought to be deployed to a DB such as MySQL soon with even more functionalitys, this is a simple     # simulation version of this bankistApp, it's completely in HTML/CS/JSS atm, enjoy it:)
